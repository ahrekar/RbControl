So,
I'm looking for the analog slave code that I wrote recently for the RS485 Analog Slave project.
.
thought i'd try this instead of email. :-)

Hey Ken. I'm not sure when you did this, but I'm guessing it wasn't as effective as the e-mail you just sent me. I'm glad to see that you're starting to try out git though!
