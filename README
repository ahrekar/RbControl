This code is used to assist in controlling and data aquisition
for the rubidium spin filter experiment at University of
Nebraska-Lincoln. A RaspberryPi is connected to a Measurement
computing DAQ device, the MCC 1208LS. Using the RaspberryPi
and the 1208LS, we can control the stepper motor, the
photomultiplier counter, and an analog controlled voltage supply. 

gnuplot is used for data visualization

Note that for the shell scripts to actually change the authors, they need to
be sourced, rather than just run as a shell script.

Not that any of this is really important to science...
