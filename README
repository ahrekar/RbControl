This code is used to assist in controlling and data aquisition
for the rubidium spin filter experiment at University of
Nebraska-Lincoln. A RaspberryPi is connected to a Measurement
computing DAQ device, the MCC 1208LS. Using the RaspberryPi
and the 1208LS, we can control the stepper motor, the
photomultiplier counter, and an analog controlled voltage supply.
